Hi, I’m August Guenther,
I’m interested in web development and learning how to effectively create various kinds of sites with both internal and external APIs. 
I'm currently working at Inflectra Corporation in Silver Spring, MD on their various add-ins and integrations with external services. 
Want to reach me? Contact me at augustTGuenther@gmail.com.
