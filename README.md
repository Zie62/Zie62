Hi, I’m August Guenther (@Zie62),
I’m interested in web development and learning how to effectively create various kinds of sites with both internal and external APIs. 
and I'm currently learning React Hooks and implementing the Johns Hopkins covid stats API into a UI as a personal project. 
I'm open to being approached to help with open source projects, and am currently seeking employment as a web developer / software developer.
Want to reach me? Contact me at augustTGuenther@gmail.com.
